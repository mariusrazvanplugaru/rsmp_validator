## Signal priority becomes completed when cancelled

Validate that a signal priority completes when we cancel it.

1. Given the site is connected
2. And we subscribe to signal priority status
3. When we send a signal priority request
4. Then the request state should become 'received'
5. Then the request state should become 'activated'
6. When we cancel the request
7. Then the state should become 'completed'

```ruby
Validator::Site.connected do |task,supervisor,site|
  timeout = Validator.get_config('timeouts','priority_completion')
  component = Validator.get_config('main_component')
  signal_group_id = Validator.get_config('components','signal_group').keys.first
  prio = Validator::StatusHelpers::SignalPriorityRequestHelper.new(
    site,
    component: component,
    signal_group_id: signal_group_id,
    timeout: timeout,
    task: task
  )
  prio.run do
    log "Before: Send unrelated signal priority request."
    prio.request_unrelated
    log "Send signal priority request, wait for reception."
    prio.request
    log "After: Send unrelated signal priority request."
    prio.request_unrelated
    prio.expect :received
    log "Signal priority request was received, wait for activation."
    prio.expect :activated
    log "Signal priority request was activated, now cancel it and wait for completion."
    prio.cancel
    prio.expect :completed
    log "Signal priority request was completed."
  end
end
```

## Signal priority becomes stale if not cancelled

Validate that a signal priority times out if not cancelled.

1. Given the site is connected
2. And we subscribe to signal priority status
3. When we send a signal priority request
4. Then the request state should become 'received'
5. Then the request state should become 'activated'
6. When we do not cancel the request
7. Then the state should become 'stale'

    prio.expect :activated
    log "Signal priority request was activated, wait for it to become stale."
    # don't cancel request, it should then become stale by itself
    prio.expect :stale
    log "Signal priority request became stale."
